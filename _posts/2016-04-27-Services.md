**Services provide a way to make the data global around the app, share data, and functionality . The services we create are singletons that can be injected into controllers and other services.**

Now to understand the use of services in angular javascript, I will try to go through some other concepts aswell : 
After working with angular Javascipt, I discovered that we can also make single page applications in angular javascript.
We can create different views in it rather than pages and we switch between views instead of pages.

**In this example I will demonstrate how to use services:**

we will have four files:
* Index.html
* LoginPage.html
* 2ndPage.html
* Controller.js


1. In Index.html :
  
  - we will declare angular app
  - we will import libraries
  - we will create ngView which is a directive that complements the $route service by including the rendered template of the current route into   the main layout (index.html) file. Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the configuration of   the $route service.
		

    **Sample Code:**
    
    <!doctype html>
        <html ng-app="angularApp">
            <head><link href="https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"  rel="stylesheet">
                <script src="//code.angularjs.org/1.3.0-rc.1/angular.min.js">
                </script>
                <script src="//code.angularjs.org/1.3.0-rc.1/angular-route.min.js"></script>
                <script src="controller.js"></script>
                <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.js"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div ng-view>
                </div>
            </body>
        </html>


2. In LoginPage.html:

We have two fields:

 1. username
 2. password
 
 as in the figure :
 

    <div ng-controller="loginController">
        <!--Sign in form-->
        <form class="form-signin" ng-submit=setName()>
        </br>
            <input type="text" ng-model="name" name="LoginUser" class="form-control" placeholder="Username" id="submitSignin" required autofocus>    
            <input type="password" ng-model="PasswordL" name="LoginPass" class="form-control" placeholder="Password" id="submitSignin" required>
            <button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit" name="submit" id="submitSignin" value="login">Sign in</button>
        </form>
    </div>
       
In this div, we have intialized the name of controller, so that as soon as user click submit, It will be linked to 'loginController' Controller ,
   
3. In 2ndPage.html:
whatever you insert into the username field that should appear in this page, 
this div will be directed to the ChatController


In Controller.js

* We will  make a module 
			var angularApp = angular.module('angularApp', ['ngRoute'])
			
*  

    angularApp.config(function ($routeProvider) {
	    $routeProvider
			.when("/",
				{templateUrl: "LoginPage.html",controller: "loginController"  })
	        .when("/2ndPage",
		        {templateUrl: "2ndPage.html", controller: "ChatController" });        
		});


*  we will make a service: 
			angularApp.service('factory', function () {
			    this.loginTrue = "";
			});



 * we will make controllers
    angularApp.controller('loginController',function($scope , $location , factory , $route)
	{
	    $scope.name='';
	    $scope.PasswordL='';   
    
	    $scope.setName=function setName(){
		      factory.loginTrue=$scope.name;
		        console.log(factory.loginTrue);
		        $location.path("/2ndPage");
		        $route.reload();
	    };
	});


	angularApp.controller('ChatController', function ($scope, factory , $location) {
	    console.log(factory.loginTrue);
	    $scope.loginUser=factory.loginTrue;
	    $scope.$apply();
	});

So basically we have created a service here to make a variable global, 
1. In the first Controller that is the loginController, We are grabbing the username the user inserts in the login Page
2. storing the value of that username in to the variable we have declared in the service to make the value global
3. Using that value that we stored in the service, we will use it in another controller and ultimately in another view.
