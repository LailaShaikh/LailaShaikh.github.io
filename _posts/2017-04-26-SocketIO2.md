**Task**


The goal of this project was to create a **Chat Application** with the following functionalities: 
	

1. Registration Functionality : Name, Password, Rooms Joined. 
2. Login Functionality
3. Searching messages in the rooms: Users must be able to search only the messages of that particular room they are in. 
4. Rooms in the Chat app:


	○ Public Room and Private rooms
	○ All registered users of the app will have the ability to see all the messages of Public room. They will also be able to add messages in the public room. 
	○ Apart from public room, students should only be able to join the private rooms that they registered in.

**Design**


Through this project, I was able to polish my skill of Flask, Angular JavaScript, CSS, Html, and PostgreSQL database which I learnt throughout the semester . I learnt the skills of using Model-View-Controller approach and the  functionality of using Socket IO for sending and receiving messages in chat functionality.


**Improvements For Future:**


 In future, I will spend more time improving the GUI for the project and rather than making a one page website.  I would like to make different pages for each functionality in the website.
