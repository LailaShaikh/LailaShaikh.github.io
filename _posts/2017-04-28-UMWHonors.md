**Goal**

The goal of this project was to create a UMW Honors Program Application. The requirement was to create a Web-based, database driven application intended to be used by the administrators and students associated with UMW honors program. The idea was to create an effective way for students to view their requirement status and progress in the honors program. It will also assist administrators to view, track and share the studentâ€™s data on a platform accessible to both students and administrators.



**Learning **


It was a group project in which my contribution made me learn a lot of new things. I learnt to work to MySQL which we used because we were to deploy our website on domains of one's own. I learnt to work with a lot of new packages of Flask including WTForms, itsdangerous, pdfkit, and Flask-Mail. 



**Improvements for future**


In future, I would like to do more testing of the project which we could not do due to limitation.
