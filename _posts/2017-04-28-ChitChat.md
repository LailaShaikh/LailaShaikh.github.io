For the website of 'chitchat', my goal was to make a video chatting application. I decided to add the feature of video communication through WebRTC. It is a project started by google, which provides API to implement in our code. I could not properly implement the feature of video communication, because I ran into the issue of integrating WebRTC with Flask. My plan is to fix the issue during summer. But overall, I found it great to work with components of bootstrap, which helped me make the GUI of the website easily and beautiful. I also polished my skills of Flask through out the semester.
