**Goal**


The goal of this project was to come up with a mock-up design of the project. By asking questions from random people and adding my ideas in it, I created a User Interface design of our project for the student dashboard. I also demoed them the User Interface after creating mockup design to know what they thought and what improvements I still needed to make. 

**Learning**


In this part of the project, I learnt the skill of making user stories to think about what the user of the project would need. I also learnt the skill of surveying people and taking the best ideas of everybody.

**Improvements for future**


In future, I will try to create the mock-up design using HTML to give more finishing to the User Interface design.
